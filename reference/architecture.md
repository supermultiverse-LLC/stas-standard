STAS-01 — Reference Implementation
Architecture Overview (v0.1)

Non-normative document
This document describes a reference architecture for implementing STAS-01.
It does not introduce new rules, override the specification, or impose specific technologies beyond Bitcoin and Taproot Assets.

1. Purpose

The purpose of this reference implementation is to demonstrate how STAS-01 can be implemented in practice while preserving:

user custody at all times

wallet agnosticism

non-custodial marketplaces

interoperability across issuers and wallets

scalability for commercial use

This document serves as an architectural guide for developers, infrastructure providers, and integrators.

2. Architectural Components

The reference implementation is composed of four independent components:

Issuer-as-a-Service

Universe

Wallet

Marketplace Coordinator

Each component can be implemented, deployed, or replaced independently.

3. Issuer-as-a-Service (IaaS)
3.1 Role

Issuer-as-a-Service provides operational infrastructure that enables issuers to mint and distribute Taproot Assets without managing low-level Bitcoin infrastructure.

It is an operational role, not a custodial one.

3.2 Responsibilities

An Issuer-as-a-Service implementation typically:

operates Taproot Assets infrastructure (tapd)

operates Lightning infrastructure (lnd)

mints Taproot Assets on behalf of issuers

attaches STAS-01 compliant metadata

transfers assets to user-provided Taproot Asset addresses

publishes asset proofs to one or more Universes

3.3 Custody Boundaries (Critical)

Issuer-as-a-Service implementations:

MUST NOT custody user wallets or private keys

MUST NOT store wallet seeds or signing material

MUST NOT sign transactions on behalf of users

MUST NOT restrict which STAS-01 compatible wallets can receive assets

All user custody is established only by transferring assets to a Taproot Asset address generated by the user’s wallet.

3.4 Interfaces (Conceptual)

A typical Issuer-as-a-Service exposes APIs similar to:

POST /collections

POST /mint

POST /transfer

POST /publish-proofs

Each request is scoped to a specific issuer or tenant.

The exact API surface is implementation-specific and outside the scope of STAS-01.

4. Universe
4.1 Role

A Universe is a discovery and synchronization layer for Taproot Asset proofs.

It enables wallets to locate and verify assets without relying on direct issuer availability.

4.2 Responsibilities

Universes typically:

store Taproot Asset proofs

serve proofs on request

support synchronization and indexing

optionally federate with other Universes

4.3 Trust Model

Universes are sources of data, not sources of trust.

Wallets MUST independently verify all proofs retrieved from a Universe.

Wallets SHOULD support:

multiple Universes

proof import through out-of-band mechanisms

5. Wallet (STAS-01 Compatible)
5.1 Role

The wallet is the sole custodian of user assets and the only component authorized to sign transactions.

It is the center of user sovereignty in the system.

5.2 Minimum Responsibilities

A STAS-01 compatible wallet MUST be able to:

generate Taproot Asset addresses

receive Taproot Assets

retrieve and verify asset proofs

resolve and verify STAS-01 metadata

display verification status to the user

authorize and sign asset transfers

authorize and sign market settlements

5.3 Trust Assumptions

A wallet:

MUST NOT trust issuers

MUST NOT trust Universes

MUST NOT trust marketplace coordinators

All verification is cryptographic.

6. Marketplace Coordinator
6.1 Role

A Marketplace Coordinator facilitates discovery and coordination for asset trading without custody.

It does not execute trades autonomously.

6.2 Responsibilities

A Marketplace Coordinator may:

index off-chain listings

facilitate Request-for-Quote (RFQ) flows

coordinate settlement between wallets

6.3 Trade Flow (Typical)

Seller wallet publishes a listing (off-chain)

Buyer wallet requests an RFQ

Coordinator returns a time-bounded, non-executable quote

Buyer explicitly authorizes the trade

Wallets execute settlement:

Lightning-based asset swap (preferred)

On-chain PSBT settlement (fallback)

Updated proofs are published to a Universe

6.4 Restrictions

Marketplace Coordinators:

MUST NOT custody assets

MUST NOT custody bitcoin

MUST NOT hold signing authority

MUST NOT lock user funds

7. End-to-End Flow
7.1 Tokenization

A user owns an off-chain collectible

The user opts into tokenization

The issuer mints a STAS-01 compliant Taproot Asset

The asset is transferred to the user’s wallet

Proofs are published to a Universe

7.2 Visualization

The wallet discovers the asset

Proofs are verified

Metadata is resolved and validated

The asset is displayed to the user

7.3 Trading

The user creates a listing

A buyer requests an RFQ

The buyer authorizes settlement

The trade settles via Lightning or on-chain

New proofs are published

8. Out of Scope

This reference implementation explicitly excludes:

UI/UX design

pricing logic

issuer identity models

compliance or KYC requirements

business rules or monetization

These concerns exist above the STAS-01 layer.

9. Relationship to Supermultiverse

Supermultiverse:

implements this reference architecture

does not control the standard

does not impose proprietary extensions

Any third party may independently implement any or all components.

10. Next Steps

Logical next steps after this reference implementation include:

visual architecture diagrams

sequence diagrams for minting and trading flows

concrete implementations of wallets or issuers

interoperability testing across implementations
